<br>
<br>
I’d like to preface this refutation by being completely open about my past.
<br>As I've always said, I have nothing to hide, and it’s very important that you know exactly what the truth 
is, and on what basis these individuals are constructing their false narrative. 
<br>
<br>
To put a long story short, back in 2020 I suffered a severe mental breakdown 
following a personal trauma. To put it briefly, my 19-year-old girlfriend at the time  
travelled to America to visit her uncle, gradually went off grid, it then surfaced 2 
months later that she had married a wealthy 51 year old man, a close friend of her 
uncles, and was pregnant with his child. Forgive me for going a bit loopy! I was 
hospitalised for 2 months due to my breakdown, and when in hospital I sent a 
whole bunch of messages to different people, which I shouldn’t have.  
<br>
<br>
I was arrested from hospital, remanded into custody, and upon sentencing I was 
given an 18-month community probation order and was released. I gradually made 
a full recovery and moved on with my life.
<br>
<br>
My full and up to date police ACRO record is available to anyone who may want to 
see it. I have never been charged with any sex related, or child related crimes.  
<br>
<br>
You will hopefully have also noticed that in the Herts Ad court listing these people 
have shared, it clearly says “Men and Women”, and not boys/girls/children.  
<br>
<br>
I’d also urge you to inspect the profile under which this post was made. You will 
notice that it’s clearly a disused/fake account with less than 20 friends. It also 
hasn’t been used since 2022 until the day the post was made. ALL of the posts 
from 2022 and prior were posted on the same day, 9th October 2022 and backdated 
with no engagement from anyone else whatsoever bar perhaps 1 or 2 likes. Need I 
say more!

        <h2>Rebuttal</h2>
        <div class="section-body">
<blockquote class="claim">(Reposted) Please Exercise Caution - (Reposted)
 
Updated - I never said that Billy was on the sex register read the statement correctly, as 
for everyone else who thinks billy such a nice guy Ive posted the messages I've had from 
him and how he talks to girls, I was a fool to believe he was single I hold my hands up 
but he a good charmer and he charmed me I stand by what I said below about Billy the 
information is in the screen shots thats from Google if you don't want to see the facts 
then google him.</blockquote>
So the above update was a direct retaliation to my post on the Ashwell Hub. 
Remarkable really to think how “Jasmin” who lives in Stevenage saw my rebuttal 
so quickly given they weren't tagged!?

I won’t even entertain the fabricated chat messages, since anybody who knows me 
is aware that I don’t speak like a socially inept teenager. A clear attempt to try to 
cause problems in my current relationship, however all it achieved was giving 
Lottie and myself a bloody good laugh!

<blockquote class="claim">--Orignal post -- 
Residents of Ashwell and surrounding villages - Advise to be vigilant regarding an 
individual known locally as Billy Jeffs, previously known as Carl Jeffs (Changed in May 
2021).</blockquote>
So I already proved this to be false in the comments of my post on the hub, but feel free to 
google it yourselves. I’ve used the name Billy since the early 2010’s and there is 
endless evidence to that effect. 

Here’s a BBC news article fron 2014 confirming this for starters:

<img src="assets/images/bbcnews.PNG" class="fullwidth">
<blockquote class="claim">Carl Jeffs has a criminal history involving serious offences against minors boys and 
girls. He was previously convicted for sending offensive texts and inappropriate texts to 
girls and boys now has a restraining order to protect the victim.</blockquote>
Again, if I were to be convicted of these kinds of crimes, I would automatically be 
on the SOR, and I am not. “I never said that Billy was on the sex register”, yes you 
did. 

<blockquote class="claim">During his incarceration/Remand, it has been reported that he admitted to a cellmate 
that he was pursuing contact with a young girl, though he claimed the girl had told him
she was older.  After serving his sentence/Remand, Carl was issued a restraining order 
relating to these individuals.</blockquote>
Firstly, these people don’t seem to have the intelligence to know that a sentence 
and being on remand are two very different things.

Secondly, they don’t have microphones in prison cells! I have no clue how such a 
conversation, had it have taken place, would ever be able to be “reported”.

<blockquote class="claim">Following public outrage in his former town of Harpendon Hertfordshire, he left the area 
and relocated to Ashwell, adopting the name Billy Jeffs i.e his middle name as Carl Billy 
Jeff which this move was to try and “restart” his life.  
Since moving to Ashwell, concerns about his behaviour have continued:</blockquote>
I did indeed leave Harpenden to leave the bad times behind and first 
moved to Stotfold above the Stag pub. It is widely known that I next moved to 
Hinxworth on Farrowby Farm, and finally to Ashwell when some lovely people 
offered me a home. 

“Carl Billy Jeff”, good one!

My full name is Carl William Jeffs, my passport and driving license is available on request! And as aforementioned, I changed to using Billy in the early 2010’s.  

<blockquote class="claim">Interaction with minors: He has observed children into his private swimming pool with 
his own CCTV on his property, which is monitored by himself only.</blockquote>
Many friends in the village have bought their children to the pool. I’m lucky to have 
it and I like to share it with all. Everybody who has been have been fully aware that I 
have CCTV in my pool area, and you may all have seen the video I posted of me 
rescuing a baby deer from the pool. It’s not a secret, and Lottie also has full access 
to it.  

<blockquote class="claim">Not only does he lie to members of the Public to defend himself his is also now lying to 
his own GF because Carl can't have children.</blockquote>
This one is comical to say the least! My partner is and has always been fully aware 
that I cannot have children 🤣

<blockquote class="claim">He has also been the one thanks very violent attacking peoples of the public in Pubs (I 
won't name the pub because the pub has nothing to do with this)</blockquote>
The grammar is incredible, my personal favourite.  

<blockquote class="claim">Conflict in public settings: He has been involved in disputes at local pubs and public 
places, often portraying himself as the victim or blaming others for his actions which we 
have all started to see is false now.</blockquote>
It quickly starts to become clear that this was written by someone with a bitter 
grudge. These statements likely refer to an incident at my local pub when I was 
verbally and physically attacked by an acquaintance of the authors, whilst sitting 
with my girlfriend, and had to defend myself. I sustained a broken nose as a result, 
which I’m now having to have surgery for.

<blockquote class="claim">When he doesn't get his own way not only does he like to start trouble but he becomes 
very scary, which if he can handle what he has caused he then calls the police and 
plays the victim.</blockquote>
I’d like to think that the last word people would use to describe me is “Scary” 😋  

<blockquote class="claim">Aggressive and manipulative behaviour: He has a documented history of aggression 
toward former partners and is known to misrepresent situations or manipulate 
narratives to his advantage.</blockquote>
I’d very much like to see these documents, why ever weren’t they included in the 
post?! 🤔 I did accidentally give Lottie a nosebleed once when the reps on holiday 
forced us to have a pool noodle fight and it caught her nose piercing 😆 but that’s 
all I can think of!  

<blockquote class="claim">His ex GF (I won't name) has also shared her views on what he is like and the word is 
very abusive and demanding when he doesn't get his own way he likes to attack them 
and then play the victim in the matter.</blockquote>
If you’d really spoken to my ex girlfriend, she’d have told you that we broke up in 
2023 and not 4 years ago as you try to suggest below 😅 

<blockquote class="claim">Parents and guardians should exercise extreme caution and ensure their children are 
supervised at all times or to avoid his property full stop, better off people are saying to 
avoid him full stop......</blockquote>
Reeeally trying to drill it now aren’t we. Very professional.  

<blockquote class="claim">Billy Jeffs is currently 37 (2nd August 1988 and is now in a relationship with a 21-year-old. which they have been together now for 4 years which this would make the ages 
when they first met (Billy - 33 and GF - 17 years old).</blockquote>
This is the best one! It is common knowledge that Lottie and I met each other and 
got together less than 2 years ago when she was 20. Here’s a picture from our first 
date!
<img src="assets/images/lottie.PNG" class="fullwidth">
<blockquote class="claim">He has been trying to deflect people by calling others *****, which he has been the one 
to text images to young child and also is the one with the restraining order.</blockquote>
No words needed at this point...  

<blockquote class="claim">Given his history and patterns of behaviour, community members are urged to remain 
vigilant, limit unsupervised interactions between him and children, and exercise 
caution in any personal interactions.  
If anyone observes concerning behaviour or believes a child may be at risk, it is strongly 
recommended to contact local authorities immediately.</blockquote>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
In summary, I hope we can agree that this post was put together by some very 
immature individuals who don’t have the foresight to realise that lies can easily be 
proven false, and that there are consequences for your actions.
<br>
<br> 
Hertfordshire  police have logged the following crime: Sending false 
communication with intent to cause harm.
<br>
<br>
The police have been incredibly proactive and supportive, and whilst investigating 
cybercrime can take some time, we are confident that the people behind this campaign will be apprehended and held fully accountable.
<br>
<br>  
Again, thank you to my friends, family and neighbours for being by my side during this unpleasantness.
<br>
<br>
